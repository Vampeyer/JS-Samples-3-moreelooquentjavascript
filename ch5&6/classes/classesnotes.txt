Classes
JavaScript’s prototype system can be interpreted as a somewhat 
free-form take on abstract data types or classes. A class defines 
the shape of a type of object—what methods and properties it has.
 Such an object is called an instance of the class.

Prototypes are useful for defining properties for which all instances
 of a class share the same value. Properties that differ per instance,
  such as our rabbits’ type property, need to be stored directly in the objects themselves.

To create an instance of a given class, you have to make an object that 
derives from the proper prototype, but you also have to make sure it itself
 has the properties that instances of this class are supposed to have. 
This is what a constructor function does.
