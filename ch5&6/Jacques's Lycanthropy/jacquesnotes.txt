The weresquirrel
Every now and then, usually between 8 p.m.
 and 10 p.m., Jacques finds himself transforming
  into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail.

On one hand, Jacques is quite glad that he doesn’t 
have classic lycanthropy. Turning into a squirrel
 does cause fewer problems than turning into a wolf.
  Instead of having to worry about accidentally eating
   the neighbor (that would be awkward), 
   he worries about being eaten by the
    neighbor’s cat. After two occasions of 
    waking up on a precariously thin branch
    in the crown of an oak, naked and disoriented,
     he has taken to locking the doors and windows 
     of his room at night and putting a few walnuts
      on the floor to keep himself busy.

But Jacques would prefer to get rid of his
 condition entirely. The irregular
  occurrences of the transformation make him suspect that
   they might be triggered by something. For a while, he believed 
   that it happened only on days when he had been near oak trees. 
   However, avoiding oak trees did not solve the problem.

Switching to a more scientific approach,
 Jacques has started keeping a daily log of everything
  he does on a given day and whether he changed form. With this data he hopes to narrow down the conditions that trigger the transformations.

The first thing he needs is a data 
structure to store this information.
