 Curves
A path may also contain curved lines. These are unfortunately
 a bit more involved to draw.

The quadraticCurveTo method draws a curve to a given point. 
To determine the curvature of the line, the method is given a 
control point as well as a destination point. Imagine this 
control point as attracting the line, giving it its curve.
 The line wonâ€™t go through
 the control point, but its direction at the start and end
  points will be such that a straight line in that direction 
  would point toward the control point. The following example
   illustrates this: -->


   <canvas></canvas>
<script>
  let cx = document.querySelector("canvas").getContext("2d");
  cx.beginPath();
  cx.moveTo(10, 90);
  // = control=(60, 10) goal=(90, 90)
  cx.quadraticCurveTo(90, -5, 300, 120);
  cx.lineTo(90, 10);
  cx.closePath();
  cx.stroke();
</script>
