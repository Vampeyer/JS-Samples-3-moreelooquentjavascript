<!-- Lines and surfaces
In the canvas interface, a shape can be filled,
 meaning its area is given a certain color or pattern,
  or it can be stroked, which means a line is drawn along its edge.
 SVG uses the same terminology.

The fillRect method fills a rectangle. It takes first
 the x- and y-coordinates of the rectangleâ€™s upper-left corner, then its width, and then its height. A similar method called strokeRect draws the outline of a rectangle.

Neither method takes any further parameters. The color
 of the fill, thickness of the stroke, and so on, are
  not determined by an argument to the method, as you might
   reasonably expect, but rather by properties of the context object.

The fillStyle property controls the way shapes are filled.
 It can be set to a string that specifies a color, using
  the color notation used by CSS.

The strokeStyle property works similarly but determines the
 color used for a stroked line. The width of that line is 
 determined by the lineWidth property,
  which may contain any positive number. -->
