<!--This example draws a filled triangle.
 Note that only two of the triangle’s sides are explicitly drawn.
 The third, from the lower-right corner back to the top,
  is implied and wouldn’t be there if you stroked the path.

You could also use the closePath method to explicitly close 
a path by adding an actual line segment back to the path’s start. 
This segment is drawn when stroking the path.  -->
