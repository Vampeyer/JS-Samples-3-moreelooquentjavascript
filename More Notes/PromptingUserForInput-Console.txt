in javascript , how can I prompt the user for a console input ? 
ChatGPT
In JavaScript, you can prompt the user for input using the prompt() function. Here's a basic example:

javascript
Copy code
let userInput = prompt("Please enter your name:");
console.log("Hello, " + userInput + "!");
When you run this code, it will display a prompt dialog with the message
 "Please enter your name:". The user can input their name, and when they
 press OK, the value they entered will be stored in the variable userInput. 
Then, the script will log a greeting message using the entered name to the console.

Keep in mind that prompt() is typically used in browser environments rather
 than in Node.js or other server-side JavaScript environments.
 If you're working in Node.js, you would use different methods 
for getting user input, such as readline.
