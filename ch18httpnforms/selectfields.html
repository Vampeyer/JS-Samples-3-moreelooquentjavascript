<!-- The square brackets in the CSS query given to querySelectorAll are used to match attributes. It selects elements whose name attribute is "color".

Select fields
Select fields are conceptually similar to radio buttons—they also
 allow the user to choose from a set of options. But where a radio 
 button puts the layout of
 the options under our control, the appearance of a <select> tag is
     determined by the browser.

Select fields also have a variant more akin to a list
 of checkboxes rather than radio boxes. When given the multiple
  attribute, a <select> tag will allow the user to select any number
     of options, rather than just a single option. Whereas a regular
      select field is drawn as a drop-down control, which shows the
       inactive options only when you open it, a field with multiple 
       enabled shows multiple options at the same time, allowing the
        user to enable or disable them individually.

Each <option> tag has a value. This value can be defined with a value 
    attribute. When that is not given, the text inside the option will
     count as its value. The value property of a <select> element reflects
         the currently selected option. For a multiple field, though,
          this property doesn’t mean much, since it will give the value
          
          of only one of the currently selected options.

The <option> tags for a <select> field can be accessed as an array-like
     object through the field’s options property. Each option has a
      property called selected, which indicates whether that option
       is currently selected. The property can also be written to
        select or deselect an option.

This example extracts the selected values from a multiple select 
field and uses them to compose a binary number from individual bits.
 Hold ctrl (or command on a Mac) to select multiple options. -->



 <select multiple>
    <option value="1">0001</option>
    <option value="2">0010</option>
    <option value="4">0100</option>
    <option value="8">1000</option>
  </select> = <span id="output">0</span>
  <script>
    let select = document.querySelector("select");
    let output = document.querySelector("#output");
    select.addEventListener("change", () => {
      let number = 0;
      for (let option of Array.from(select.options)) {
        if (option.selected) {
          number += Number(option.value);
        }
      }
      output.textContent = number;
    });
  </script>
