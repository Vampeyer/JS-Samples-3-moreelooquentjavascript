<!-- File fields
File fields were originally designed as a way to upload files 
from the user’s machine
 through a form. In modern browsers, they also provide a way to 
 read such files from JavaScript programs. The field acts as a
  kind of gatekeeper. The script cannot simply start reading 
  private files from the user’s computer, but if the user selects
   a file in such a field, the browser interprets that action to mean 
   that the script may read the file.

A file field usually looks like a button labeled with something
 like “choose file” or “browse”, with information about the 
 chosen file next to it. -->


 <input type="file">
<script>
  let input = document.querySelector("input");
  input.addEventListener("change", () => {
    if (input.files.length > 0) {
      let file = input.files[0];
      console.log("You chose", file.name);
      if (file.type) console.log("It has type", file.type);
    }
  });
</script>
