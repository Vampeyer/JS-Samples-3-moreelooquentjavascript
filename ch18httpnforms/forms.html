<!-- A lot of field types use the <input> tag. This tag’s type attribute is used to select the field’s style. These are some commonly used <input> types:

text	A single-line text field
password	Same as text but hides the text that is typed
checkbox	An on/off switch
color	A color
date	A calendar date
radio	(Part of) a multiple-choice field
file	Allows the user to choose a file from their computer
Form fields do not necessarily have to appear in a <form> tag.
     You can put them anywhere in a page. Such form-less fields 
     cannot be submitted (only a form as a whole can), but when 
     responding to input with JavaScript, we often don’t 
    want to submit our fields normally anyway. -->




<p><input type="text" value="abc"> (text)</p>
<p><input type="password" value="abc"> (password)</p>
<p><input type="checkbox" checked> (checkbox)</p>
<p><input type="color" value="orange"> (color)</p>
<p><input type="date" value="2023-10-13"> (date)</p>
<p><input type="radio" value="A" name="choice">
   <input type="radio" value="B" name="choice" checked>
   <input type="radio" value="C" name="choice"> (radio)</p>
<p><input type="file"> (file)</p>





<!-- Multiline text fields have their own tag, <textarea>, 
    mostly because using an attribute to specify a multiline starting 
    value would be awkward. The <textarea> tag requires a matching </textarea> closing tag and uses the text 
between those two, instead of the value attribute, as starting text. -->



<textarea>
    one
    two
    three
    </textarea>























    <!-- Finally, the <select> tag is used to create 
        a field that allows the
         user to select from a number of predefined options. -->


    <select>
        <option>Pancakes</option>
        <option>Pudding</option>
        <option>Ice cream</option>
      </select>
