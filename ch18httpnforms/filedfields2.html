<!-- The files property of a file field element is an array-like object
 (once again, not a real array) containing the files chosen in the
  field. It is initially empty. The reason there isn’t simply a file
   property is that file fields also support a multiple attribute,
    which makes it possible to select multiple files at the same time.

The objects in files have properties such as name (the filename),
 size (the file’s size in bytes, which are chunks of 8 bits), 
 and type (the media type of the file, such as text/plain or image/jpeg).

What it does not have is a property that contains the content
 of the file. Getting at that is a little more involved.
  Since reading a file from disk can take time, the interface
   is asynchronous to avoid 
freezing the window. -->


<input type="file" multiple>
<script>
  let input = document.querySelector("input");
  input.addEventListener("change", () => {
    for (let file of Array.from(input.files)) {
      let reader = new FileReader();
      reader.addEventListener("load", () => {
        console.log("File", file.name, "starts with",
                    reader.result.slice(0, 2000));
      });
      reader.readAsText(file);
    }
  });
