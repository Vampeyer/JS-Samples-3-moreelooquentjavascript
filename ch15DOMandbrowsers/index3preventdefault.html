<!-- Default actions
Many events have a default action. If you click a link, you will be taken
 to the link’s target. If you press the down arrow, the browser will scroll
  the page down.
 If you right-click, you’ll get a context menu. And so on.

For most types of events, the JavaScript event handlers are 
called before the default behavior takes place. If the handler
 doesn’t want this normal behavior to happen, typically because
  it has already taken care of handling the event, it can call the
   preventDefault method on the event object.

This can be used to implement your own keyboard shortcuts or context menu. It can also be used to obnoxiously interfere with the behavior that users expect. For example, here is a link that cannot be followed: -->

<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/">MDN</a>
<script>
  let link = document.querySelector("a");
  link.addEventListener("click", event => {
    console.log("Nope.");
    event.preventDefault();
  });
</script>
