Most event objects have a target property that refers to the node where they originated. You can use this property to ensure that youâ€™re not accidentally handling something that propagated up from a node you do not want to handle.

It is also possible to use the target property to cast a wide net for a specific type of event. For example, if you have a node containing a long list of buttons, it may be more convenient to register a single click handler on the outer node and have it use the target property to figure out whether a button was clicked,
 rather than registering individual handlers on all of the buttons.
